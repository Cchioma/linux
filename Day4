Execute the following commands after creating the directory and file
NB: Remember to update the steps you took

ls -la /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh 
sudo chmod 555 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh 
ls -la /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh 


I used the pwd command to confirm my current working directory.
I navigated to the system temporary directory using cd /tmp.
I confirmed I was inside the /tmp directory by running the pwd command again.
I created a file named xfusioncorp.sh using the touch xfusioncorp.sh command.
I checked the file permissions using ls -la /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh.
I changed the file permissions to 555 using sudo chmod 555 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh.
I verified that the permissions changed successfully by running ls -la /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh again.
I executed the file using . /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh to confirm that the permissions were effective.
I navigated back to my project directory.
I used the git status command to check for modified and untracked files.
I used the git add Day4 command to stage the updated Day4 file.
I used the git commit -m "Updated Day4 with xfusioncorp.sh task" command to commit my changes with a meaningful message.
I used the git push command to push my changes to my GitHub repository.

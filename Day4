Execute the following commands after creating the directory and file
NB: Remember to update the steps you took

ls -la /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh 
sudo chmod 555 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh 
ls -la /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh 


I navigated to /tmp using cd /tmp.
I created a file named xfusioncorp.sh using the touch command.
I checked the file permissions using ls -la /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh.
I changed the file permissions to 555 using sudo chmod 555 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh.
I verified the permissions changed using ls -la /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh.
I executed the file using . /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh.
